= How does Auto Ad Inserter work? =

As soon as [Auto Ad Inserter](https://www.revenueflex.com/auto-ad-inserter) is activated on your server, the plugin's script will be injected into your web pages. The script tries to load the ad configuration from RevenueFlex servers when a visitor loads the page.

Initially, there is no ad configuration because our servers don't even know such a page exists before anyone accesses the page. After a visitor loads your page, our servers start creating a configuration for the requested page.

One of our servers downloads the page and analyzes the page based on your custom plugin settings and creates a page configuration. This configuration is used to determine ad positions for the remaining impressions of the page. 

Our servers create a different configuration for each requested page of your site. We do not overload your web server as we limit the number of parallel connections to your website. This means that we process pages one by one and you won't see the revenue increase right away (but the effects will be seen within a few hours).

<strong>We don't collect user-specific data. Auto Ad inserter Wordpress Plugin configuration uses page content, country, and plugin settings.</strong>

   * This dashboard is designed for representing statistical data about the registered web pages. All these data provide statistics of how effectively Auto Ad Inserter works with the web pages by collecting the number of total auto ads, page views, etc.

   * In addition, It mainly consists of 2 buttons;  Project Settings, and User Settings. 

   <strong> Project Settings </strong>

   	* This button is used to create a configuration set for web pages. A user can do the following:

   	* Add web pages to the “Project Domains” field to specify on which sites the plugin will work.

   	* Select the “RevenueFlex Enabled” checkbox to decide whether the plugin will work or not on the web pages.

	* Enter “Google Adsense Publisher Id”

	* Choose how much ad density should be on preset web pages not only on mobile but also on desktop pages

	* Filter the pages that the plugin will not work on. Users can express the entire address in “Exact Match” or regex expression in “Starts With” 

    <strong> User Settings </strong>
